The Exceptions are of two types: 

1. RuntimeException (unchecked exceptions)
2. IOException (compile-time exceptions)(checked exceptions)

------------------------------------------------------------
1. RuntimeException (unchecked exceptions)

- A runtime exception happens due to a programming error. They are also known as unchecked exceptions.
- These exceptions are not checked at compile-time(compiler ignores) but checked at run-time. 
Examples:
* Improper use of an API - IllegalArgumentException
* Null pointer access (missing the initialization of a variable) - NullPointerException
* Out-of-bounds array access - ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
* Dividing a number by 0 - ArithmeticException


2. IOException (compile-time exceptions)(checked exceptions)

- An IOException is also known as a checked exception.
- They are checked by the compiler at the compile-time and the programmer is prompted to handle these exceptions.
Examples:
* Trying to open a file that doesnâ€™t exist results in FileNotFoundException
* Trying to read past the end of a file
