Exception: An exception is an unexpected event that occurs during program execution.
It affects the flow of the program instructions which can cause the program to terminate abnormally.

Exception hierarchy:

- Throwable class is the root class in the hierarchy.


               ------------> Error
               |
               |
Throwable -----|                         ----> Run time exception (unchecked exceptions)
               |                         |
               ------------> Exception --|
                                         |
                                         ----> IO exception (checked exception)
                                       
 
Error: 
 - Errors represent irrecoverable conditions such as Java virtual machine (JVM) running out of memory,
 memory leaks, stack overflow errors, library incompatibility, infinite recursion, etc.
 - Errors are usually beyond the control of the programmer and we should not try to handle errors.
 
Exception:
 - Exceptions can be caught and handled by the program.
 - When an exception occurs within a method, it creates an object. This object is called the exception object.
