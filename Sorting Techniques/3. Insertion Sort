Insertion Sort: Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands.
The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the
correct position in the sorted part.

---------
Algorithm:

1. We start with second element of given array i.e element at index 1, which shall be the key.
The key element here is the new card that we need to add to existing sorted set of cards.

2. We compare the key element with element(s) before it, in this element at index 0:
   2.1 If the key element is less than first element, we insert the key element before first element.
   2.2 If the key element is greater than first element, we insert the key element after first element.
   
3. Similarly, we make third element as the key element and compare it with elements to it's left and insert it at the correct position.

4. Repeat the process, until array is sorted.

Example:

class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] a = {5, 1, 6, 2, 4, 3};
        int temp, j;
        for(int i=1; i<a.length;i++)
        {
            temp = a[i];
            j=i;
            while(j>0 && a[j-1]>temp)
            {
                a[j]=a[j-1];
                j=j-1;
            }
            a[j] = temp;
        }
        for(int i=0; i<a.length;i++)
        {
            System.out.print(a[i]+" ");
        }
    }
}
