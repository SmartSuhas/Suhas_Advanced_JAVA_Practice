Escape character in Java Strings
The escape character is used to escape some of the characters present inside a string.

Suppose we need to include double quotes inside a string.

// include double quote 
String example = "This is the "String" class";
Since strings are represented by double quotes, the compiler will treat "This is the " as the string. Hence, the above code will cause an error.

To solve this issue, we use the escape character \ in Java. For example,

// use the escape character
String example = "This is the \"String\" class.";

Now escape characters tell the compiler to escape double quotes and read the whole text.
