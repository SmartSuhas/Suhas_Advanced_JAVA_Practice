In Java, strings are immutable. This means, once we create a string, we cannot change that string.

To understand it more deeply, consider an example:

// create a string
String example = "Hello! ";

Here, we have created a string variable named example. The variable holds the string "Hello! ".

Now suppose we want to change the string.

// add another string "World", to the previous tring example

example.concat(" World");

Here, we are using the concat() method to add another string World to the previous string.

It looks like we are able to change the value of the previous string. However, this is not true.

Let's see what has happened here,

JVM takes the first string "Hello! "
creates a new string by adding "World" to the first string
the first string "Hello! " remains unchanged

-----
Example:

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String example = "Hello! ";
    example.concat("World");
    System.out.println(example);
  }   
}

o/p:
Hello!
