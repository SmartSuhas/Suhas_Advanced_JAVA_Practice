In Java, the JVM maintains a string pool to store all of its strings inside the memory. The string pool helps in reusing the strings.

1. While creating strings using string literals,

String example = "Java";

Here, we are directly providing the value of the string (Java). Hence, the compiler first checks the string pool to see if the string already exists.

If the string already exists, the new string is not created. Instead, the new reference, 'example' points to the already existed string (Java).
If the string doesn't exist, the new string (Java) is created.

2. While creating strings using the new keyword,

String example = new String("Java");

Here, the value of the string is not directly provided.
Hence, a new "Java" string is created even though "Java" is already present inside the memory pool.
