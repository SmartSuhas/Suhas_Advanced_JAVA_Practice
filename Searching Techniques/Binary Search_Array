Binary Search Approach: Binary Search is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. 

Algorithm:
- Begin with an interval covering the whole array (Between li and hi). 
- If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. 
- Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. 
- Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.
