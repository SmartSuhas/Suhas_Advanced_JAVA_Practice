To find largest or smallest element at Kth position, suppose there are 1000 elements and if k=100,
then program will find largest or smallest value at 100th position, this can be achieved using sorting,
we will sort the array in descending order only until Kth position and print smallest or largest at Kth position,
rest of the elements after Kth position are ignored.
