Note: We traverse the array from the end and push individual elements at current position to next its position
until we reach the position (from the end) where the new element needs to be inserted. As array size cannot be modified
once delcared and we keep pushing elements from current position to next its position, the last element of array will
be lost after instertion of new element.

Example: 

import java.util.*;
public class ArrayTest {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       
      int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
      
      int pos = 3; //element to be inserted a 3rd position i.e index = 2
      int newElement = 100;
      
      for(int i=a.length-1; i>pos-1; i--)    //pos-1 because index value starts from zero
      {
          a[i] = a[i-1]; //replacing value at current position with previous position value until position of element to be inserted is reached
      }
      a[pos-1] = newElement;
      System.out.println("Array after insertion: "+Arrays.toString(a));
   }
}

o/p:

Array after insertion: [1, 2, 100, 3, 4]
