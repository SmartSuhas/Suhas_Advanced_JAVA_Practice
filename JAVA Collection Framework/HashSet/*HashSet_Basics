Java Set:
- Set is child interface of collections
- used to represent group of individual objects as single entity
- Duplication is NOT allowed
- insertion order is not preserved
- Doesn't contain any new methods. we use collections interface methods only

-----------------------------------------------------------
HashSet: The HashSet class of the Java Collections framework provides the functionalities of the hash table data structure.

- HashSet stores the elements by using a mechanism called hashing.
- HashSet contains unique elements only, no duplicates.
- HashSet allows null value.
- HashSet doesn't maintain the insertion order. Here, elements are inserted on the basis of their hashcode.
- HashSet is the best approach for search operations.
- The initial default capacity of HashSet is 16, and the load factor is 0.75.

------------------------------------------------------------
Difference between List and Set:
A list can contain duplicate elements whereas Set contains unique elements only.

------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax: HashSet h = new HashSet();

Constructors of Java HashSet class:

1)	HashSet() -	It is used to construct a default HashSet.
2)	HashSet(int capacity)	- It is used to initialize the capacity of the hash set to the given integer value capacity.
    The capacity grows automatically as elements are added to the HashSet.
3)	HashSet(int capacity, float loadFactor)	- It is used to initialize the capacity of the hash set to the given 
    integer value capacity and the specified load factor.
4)	HashSet(Collection<? extends E> c)	It is used to initialize the hash set by using the elements of the collection c.
