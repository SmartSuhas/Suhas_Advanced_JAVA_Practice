The performance of the hashmap is based upon two significant factors :

1. Initial Capacity
2. Load Factor

 - Initial Capacity: The initial number of buckets a hashmap has when its instance is created.
Its default value is 16. That is, initially, the hash map can store 16 key-value elements.

 - Load Factor: It is a measure of how much percentage the hashmap is allowed to fill before its capacity increases.
The default load factor value is 0.75, ranging between 0 to 1 usually.

 - Threshold: It is the product of the load factor and the capacity of the hashmap.
Default threshold value is 0.75*16= 12. When 12 elements are filled in the hashmap,
we need to stop inserting more elements into it. Rehashing will be done,
which will double the capacity of the hashmap.

 - Rehashing: It is a way of doubling the capacity when the threshold value is reached. 
When the threshold value is crossed, the rehashing is done so that the bucket now
has twice the capacity and the operation takes less time.
