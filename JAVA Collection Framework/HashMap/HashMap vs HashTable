HashMap:

1. No method is synchronized.	
2. Multiple threads can operate simultaneously and hence hashmap’s object is not thread-safe.
3. Threads are not required to wait and hence relatively performance is high.
4. Null is allowed for both key and value.
5. It is introduced in the 1.2 version.	
6. It is non-legacy.

HashTable:

1. Every method is synchronized.
2. At a time only one thread is allowed to operate the Hashtable’s object. Hence it is thread-safe.
3. It increases the waiting time of the thread and hence performance is low.
4. Null is not allowed for both key and value. Otherwise, we will get a null pointer exception.
5. It is introduced in the 1.0 version.
6. It is a legacy.
