- The LinkedList class of the Java collections framework provides the functionality of the linked list data structure (doubly linkedlist).
- Java LinkedList class can contain duplicate elements.
- Java LinkedList class maintains insertion order.
- Java LinkedList class is non synchronized.
- In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to occur.
- Java LinkedList class can be used as a list, stack or queue.
- Best approach for inserting and deleting elements in between.
- Null insertion is possible

------------------------
Each element in a linked list is known as a node. It consists of 3 fields:

Prev - stores an address of the previous element in the list. It is null for the first element
Next - stores an address of the next element in the list. It is null for the last element
Data - stores the actual data

-------------------------
* Working of a Java LinkedList: Checkout the 3rd image in 'images' folder for LinkedList implementation (IMPORTANT)

-------------------------
Declaration: LinkedList<Type> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();

Constructors of Java LinkedList:

1. LinkedList() - It is used to construct an empty list.
2. LinkedList(Collection c) - It is used to construct a list containing the elements of the specified collection,
   in the order, they are returned by the collection's iterator.
