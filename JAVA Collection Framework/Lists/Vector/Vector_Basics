- The Vector class is an implementation of the List interface that allows us to create resizable-arrays similar to the ArrayList class.

---------------------------
It is similar to the ArrayList, but with two differences-

1. Vector is synchronized.
2. Java Vector contains many legacy methods that are not the part of a collections framework.

---------------------------
Creating a Vector: Vector<Type> vector = new Vector<>();

Java Vector Constructors:

1)	vector()	It constructs an empty vector with the default size as 10.
2)	vector(int initialCapacity)	It constructs an empty vector with the specified initial capacity and with its capacity increment equal to zero.
3)	vector(int initialCapacity, int capacityIncrement)	It constructs an empty vector with the specified initial capacity and capacity increment.
4)	Vector( Collection<? extends E> c)	It constructs a vector that contains the elements of a collection c.
