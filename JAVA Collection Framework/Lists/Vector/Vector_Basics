- The Vector class is an implementation of the List interface that allows us to create resizable-arrays similar to the ArrayList class.

Note: All features of Vector is same as ArrayList, only differences are listed below.
---------------------------
It is similar to the ArrayList, but with two differences-

1. Vector is synchronized. Thread-safe.
2. Java Vector contains many legacy methods that are not the part of a collections framework.

---------------------------
Creating a Vector: Vector<Type> vector = new Vector<>();

Java Vector Constructors:

1) Vector() - It constructs an empty vector with the default size as 10.
2) Vector(int initialCapacity) - It constructs an empty vector with the specified initial capacity and with its capacity increment equal to zero.
3) Vector(int initialCapacity, int capacityIncrement) - It constructs an empty vector with the specified initial capacity and capacity increment.
4) Vector(Collection c) - It constructs a vector that contains the elements of a collection c.
