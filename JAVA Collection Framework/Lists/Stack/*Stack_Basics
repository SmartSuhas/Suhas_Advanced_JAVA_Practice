- The Java collections framework has a class named Stack that provides the functionality of the stack data structure.
- It is based on Last-In-First-Out (LIFO).
- The Stack class extends the Vector class.
- The stack data structure has the two most important operations that are push and pop.
  The push operation inserts an element into the stack and pop operation removes an element from the top of the stack.
  - When we push an element into the stack the top is increased by 1
  - When we pop an element from the stack the value of top is decreased by 1
