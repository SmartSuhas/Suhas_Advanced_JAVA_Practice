 - In Java, elements of Map are stored in key/value pairs.
 
 - Both keys and values are objects and each key-value pair is called as entry. So Map is called as collection of entry objects.
 
 - A map cannot contain duplicate keys, but values can be duplicate. And, each key is associated with a single value.
 
 - Note: The Map interface maintains 3 different sets:
      1. the set of keys
      2. the set of values
      3. the set of key/value associations (mapping).
      
      Hence we can access keys, values, and associations individually.
      
--------------------------------
Classes that implement Map are:

1. HashMap
2. EnumMap
3. LinkedHashMap
4. WeakHashMap
5. TreeMap

Methods of Map:

1. put(K, V) - Inserts the association of a key K and a value V into the map. If the key is already present,
               the new value replaces the old value and returns old value. But if Key is unique then it returns null.
               
2. putAll() - Inserts all the entries from the specified map to this map.
    
3. putIfAbsent(K, V) - Inserts the association if the key K is not already associated with the value V.

4. get(K) - Returns the value associated with the specified key K. If the key is not found, it returns null.

5. getOrDefault(K, defaultValue) - Returns the value associated with the specified key K. If the key is not found, it returns the defaultValue.

6. containsKey(K) - Checks if the specified key K is present in the map or not.

7. containsValue(V) - Checks if the specified value V is present in the map or not.

8. replace(K, V) - Replace the value of the key K with the new specified value V.

9. replace(K, oldValue, newValue) - Replaces the value of the key K with the new value newValue only if the key K is associated with the value oldValue.

10. remove(K) - Removes the entry from the map represented by the key K.

11. remove(K, V) - Removes the entry from the map that has key K associated with value V.

12. keySet() - Returns a set of all the keys present in a map.

13. values() - Returns a set of all the values present in a map.

14. entrySet() - Returns a set of all the key/value mapping present in a map.

15. size() - It's used to return the number of key-value mappings in this map.

16. isEmpty() - used to check is given Map is empty or not.

17. clear() - used to clear and remove all of the elements or mappings from a specified Map collection.
